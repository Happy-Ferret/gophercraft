# Gophercraft (WIP)

![gopher](gopher.png)

Gophercraft is a Go library for the World of Warcraft 3.3.5a protocol.

Gophercraft is in currently development: expect a lack of features and expect the API to change frequently.

Remember, contributions are always welcome. If you've added additional functionality, why not submit a pull request?

## Goals

- Auth protocol client âœ“
- Worldserver protocol client
- Authserver
- Scriptable worldserver
